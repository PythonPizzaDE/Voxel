# Voxel

This is a little Voxel thingy I use for practicing my OpenGL *skills*.

To build this beast on linux you have to install the following libraries with your package manager(just google):
- GLEW
- GLFW
- GLM
- stb

To run it:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/PythonPizzaDE/Voxel.git
$ cd Voxel
$ make run
```
